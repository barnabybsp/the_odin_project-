        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced chicken, olive oil, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, and lime juice. Toss everything together until the chicken is well coated with the marinade. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>

            <li>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and toss everything together for another minute to heat through and combine the flavors.</li>
            <li>Warm the flour tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave. Serve the chicken and vegetable mixture on the tortillas, and add your favorite toppings such as salsa, guacamole, sour cream, or shredded cheese. Enjoy your delicious chicken fajitas!</li>
